I have implemented 3 jug problem using the data structure concept of state-space search and backtracking , structures.We have initial(set) state and final(goal) state.To reach final state, state space search is used.Since 6 transitions are required so 6 transition functions are to generate state.

gcc A3_client_PES1201801932.c A3_impl_PES1201801932.c
./a.out < input.txt

Learnt the concept of backtracking and state space search,use of doubly linked lists for solving the problems
