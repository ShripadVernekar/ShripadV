Data structure Used
    The main data structure used is adjacency lists concept i.e array of linked lists
    where the following lists contains the competitors who lost to the root.

Key takeaway
   From this assignment i got to know about the Binary counter and the way to implement it using tournament method(which i was not knowing before)
   Two pointer method , i thought this method was used only for sorting but it was a great help to me in this assignment to figure out 2nd largest (which i used in implementation)
   Lastly the number of comparisons which is normally lesser then others

To compile 
	gcc file.c -lm
	-lm should be used since i have used log and ceil math functions
